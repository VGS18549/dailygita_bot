# dailygita_bot
"During my first venture into programming, I created a magnificent Telegram bot. Upon receiving the command '**Vasudeva**,' It effectively called up the random verses from the 18 adhyayas of the Bhagavad Gita.
 To achieve this feat, I employed three Python files:

1. '**main.py**': To give the bot life, I used the Python Telegram Bot library, uniting modern technology with ancient wisdom.

2. '**const.py**': In this file, I securely stored the API key, acting as a bridge between users and the bot's celestial powers.

3. '**responses.py**': Here, I skillfully extracted the sacred verses from the Bhagavad Gita's rich treasury, presenting users with the profound teachings of this sacred text.

This creation goes beyond being a mere project; it marks the beginning of my programming journey, connecting technology with timeless wisdom in a way that leaves a lasting impact."
