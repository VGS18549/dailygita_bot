# dailygita_bot
It's a basic Telegram bot that, in response to the command Vasudeva, generates Bhagavat Gita slokas.
This was my first project where I used my fundamental programming skills.
I started by making three Python files for this project.
- **main.py**

    I imported the python-telegram-bot package into this file.
    
- **const.py**

    Here I stored my API key 
    
- **responses.py**

    I've built code to extract a random sloka from the.csv file in this document.
