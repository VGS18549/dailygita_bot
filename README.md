## Description
During my first venture into programming, I created a magnificent Telegram bot [![chatroom icon](https://patrolavia.github.io/telegram-badge/chat.png)](https://t.me/dailygita_bot). Upon receiving the command '**Vasudeva**,' It effectively called up the random verses from the 18 adhyayas of the Bhagavad Gita.


## Requirements
- `pip3 install python-telegram-bot`
- `pip3 install pandas`

## Program
To achieve this feat, I created three Python files:

1. `main.py`: To give the bot life, I used the Python Telegram Bot library, uniting modern technology with ancient wisdom.

2. `const.py`: In this file, I securely stored the API key, acting as a bridge between users and the bot's celestial powers.

3. `responses.py`: Here, I skillfully extracted the sacred verses from the Bhagavad Gita's rich treasury, presenting users with the profound teachings of this sacred text.

This creation goes beyond being a mere project; it marks the beginning of my programming journey, connecting technology with timeless wisdom in a way that leaves a lasting impact.
